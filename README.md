# HedgehogRoll
This is a game that I created on Unity. The three scripts are cameraController, canvasController, and playerController, all in c#. The playerController controls the hedgehog. It controls it's speed & range of motion, how the game starts/where it starts, it's rigidbody, when the game updates, the life & death of objects that have their trigger on, and more. The cameraController controls the camera's range of motion, how far away it is from the hedgehog, where it starts, and when it updates. The canvasController controls the canvas, how many points you start with in the game, when the game updates,
